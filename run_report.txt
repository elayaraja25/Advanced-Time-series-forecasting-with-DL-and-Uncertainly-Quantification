Final Project Report - Time Series Forecasting (LSTM MC Dropout + Baselines)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data source: yfinance
Rows: 2844
Date range: 2015-01-02 to 2025-11-26

Model (deep): LSTM with Monte Carlo Dropout
 - Input window: 60 days, Forecast horizon: 7 days
 - Hidden size: 64, layers: 2, dropout: 0.2
 - MC runs: 200

Baselines:
 - ARIMA(5,1,0) fitted on training series (simple baseline).
 - Prophet (if available) fitted on training series (optional).

Results (on test windows):
 - LSTM-MC: RMSE=415.3830, MAE=409.5665, Coverage90=0.6507, NRMSE=0.215934
 - ARIMA: RMSE=727.0561, MAE=723.7719, Coverage90=0.0007
 - Prophet: RMSE=1326.2069, MAE=1324.3083, Coverage90=0.0000

Calibration analysis:
 - Coverage by horizon (LSTM): [0.6722, 0.6699, 0.689, 0.6722, 0.61, 0.7368, 0.5048]
 - PIT approx samples saved as PIT histogram (pit_hist.jpg).

Files produced:
- sp500_close.csv (dataset)
- best_mc_lstm.pth (saved model weights)
- mc_lstm_traced.pt (TorchScript export, if successful)
- forecast_sample_comparison.jpg (sample plot)
- coverage_by_horizon_lstm.jpg
- pit_hist.jpg
- comparison_table.csv (comparison table)
- run_report.txt

Notes & Next steps:
- ARIMA fitting and Prophet are provided as baselines; depending on data quantity and frequency, consider applying auto_arima
- For production: persist scaler, model exports, add a serving wrapper (FastAPI/Flask), implement monitoring & periodic retraining
- For better uncertainty: ensemble multiple architectures + MC Dropout or use quantile/heteroscedastic models
